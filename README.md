# robloxGFX
so uh, hello! i'm Cann0tBeFound, formally known as "CodaRum", and i'm a GFX artist, who has been working in that field for around a year.

i make stuff like roblox GFXs using various tools and i'm using this GitHub page as a showcase for my current work.

i will be showing the 6 most recent GFX projects that i've made, as i think these are the most pleasant looking.

these all are screenshots of the actual .PNG file and currently i can not upload the file directly due to it's huge size and due to GitHub's 10 MB limit, sorry

currently i want to apply for Federation Studios because i had an interest in working within the Studio, and be able to expand my skills and experience as time goes on during my time as a Contractor.

i have applied before and my application was denied, and understandably so because i had subpar experience, and now i have tried to make things more pleasant looking, through gaining more experiences with Photoshop 2021 and other editing programs, plus using opinions and comments on said GFXs, to improve my work in the future using these comments (both negative and positive).

i'm looking forward for this application, this should be my showcase.

benefits: able to produce work in quick settings (2 days to 1 week maximum for a single finished GFX) - have decent experience with Photoshop - able to produce subpar pixel art (beneficial for t-shirt work if requested) - able to take criticism and apply it to the work, to improve on said work

downsides: can lack motivation/have motivational issues (can affect progress and overall efficiency) - can not do more advanced work in Blender due to a lack of personal experience (working on that for now)
